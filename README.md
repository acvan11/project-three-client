# Ginkgo Budgeting

Ginkgo is a simple budgeting tool that allows you to set financial goals, track your spending and income, and compare your spending with your goals on a month-by-month basis.

### Design and concept

Ginkgo is a budgeting tool for visual thinkers. On the profile page, the user can see a doughnut chart showing the breakdown of their monthly budget and their monthly spending. It's easy to see when certain categories get out of balance. The profile page also displays a bar chart that shows actual spending vs budget for each category so the user can determine at a glance whether their spending is in line with their budgeting.

Ginkgo tracks spending by date and by category. On the profile page, the user can see a summary of spending, but on the Expenses page, the user can see a record of expenditures sorted by date and type. On the Income page, the user can see a detailed record of all income sources and instances, sorted by date and separated by month.

### User stories 

As a Gingko user:
 * I want to set a budget for different categories of expenses, like housing, transportation, and entertainment.
 * I want to record expenditures and income, and see lists of my previous expenditures and income.
 * I want to compare my spending-to-date with the budget I set.

### Technologies

Ginkgo is a full-stack decoupled app built with React, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, and NodeJS.

### Third-party APIs

Gingko uses the following APIs:
* React-vis: a data visualization library that makes Gingko's beautiful and informative charts
* MomentJS: helps parse and display dates so Gingko can easily keep track of spending by month
